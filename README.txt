----------THIS IS A SCHOOL PROJECT---------- (26/01/2019)

basic idea:
The idea is to create a wheel that spins. On the wheel will be pictures of animals.
Once the wheel stops spinnging there should be an animalsound that corosponds with the picture.

We are planing on useing somekind of magnetic counting system to see what picture the wheel stoped on

Currently I am figering out how to use the pi zero, but I will probebly switch to a pi 3 B+ since it has a audiojacked.

tips and/help is alwais welcome, but keep in mind its a project for me to learn how this works.

updats will be posted here to. 
Thank you for reading, have a nice day
